    From 2008 to 2017, Missouri school districts gave more than 2.5 million in-school and out-of-school suspensions.
    Black students accounted for more than 40 percent of those suspensions, even though they've never accounted for more than 20 percent of Missouri's public school enrollment in any given year.
  </p>
  <p>
    This tool allows you to search the number of suspensions given in your own school district. It is best experienced on a desktop-sized screen.
  </p>
  <p>
    A few notes to help you interpret the results:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A value of "N/A" means that the value was not present in the suspension dataset. This value does not necessarily equate to 0 suspensions. The data obtained from the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education had cells with less than 5 suspensions redacted from the dataset to protect student privacy.</li>
    <li>The disparity index is a value that shows whether certain racial groups were over- or underrepresented in suspensions.  To calculate the disparity index, we divided each racial groupâ€™s percentage share of suspensions by their enrollment percentage.</li>
    <li>A disparity index value above 1 indicates that a group accounts for a higher proportion of suspensions than its percentage of the population would predict. A value less than 1 indicates that a group accounts for a lesser proportion of suspension than its percentage of the population would predict.</li>
    <li>It is important to note that this dataset tracks the number of suspensions given, NOT the number of unique students suspended. If a record states that there were 10 suspensions given, it could mean that 10 students were suspended once or that 5 students were suspended twice each.</li>
  </ul>
